Magnetron2
==========

Updated version of magnetron using DNest 4. 

Magnetron is a code to model one-dimensional data (e.g. time series) 
with a superposition of simple shapes. The number of components in the 
superposition is part of the model and need not be known beforehand.

Magnetron2 originally used a **Poisson Likelihood**, since it 
was written for X-ray data of magnetar bursts. This version is adjusted from the
so that it works for fast radio bursts (FRBs) which is data that has 
normally distributed uncertainties. 

Dependencies
============

- DNest4
- python 3.5 
- numpy
- scipy

Installation
============

First, make sure DNest4 is installed and the ``DNEST4_PATH`` variable set correctly.
Also, please run ``python setup.py install`` in the python directory of DNest4.

In this case, installing ``magnetron2`` should be as simple as typing ``make`` in the ``/code/``
directory!

Running the Code
================

``magnetron2`` unfortunately doesn't have a super convenient user interface. File names of 
data files to be run generally need to be changed directly in ``main.cpp``. For automatization, 
you can use the ``run_dnest.py`` script, which automatically reads all files with a certain 
matching string in a given directory and will run magnetron2 on each file one after the other. 
Be aware that the script is a bit hacky and not the ideal version to do this, but this is 
what we have.

Documentation
=============

Coming soon!
